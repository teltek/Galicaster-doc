Plugins
=======

*This page is updated to the 2.1 version*

Plugins are independent modules that provide a specific feature to Galicaster without affecting its normal behaviour and can be enabled or disabled separately. They may also have some sort of configuration to control its behaviour.
Plugins communicate with Galicaster in a very simple way, by connecting to the inner signals of the program. They also can retrieve information from different elements of the application - repository, profiles, network status, GUI, etc.

The following list enumerates the current available plugins at the 2.0.0 release. Each plugin's functionality and configuration are briefly explained on its corresponding section in this page.

### Screensaver for Ubuntu 16.04
This plugin uses the Xorg system and the DBUS application interface to provide an automatic screensaver control for Galicaster. In order to work properly, this plugin requires both the screensaver and tge power management system to be disabled.

#### Behaviour
* Disables the screensaver when a recording is active.
* Enables the screensaver when no recordings are active.
  * The screensaver is displayed after a certain **inactivity** time (in seconds). The value of `inactivity` is configurable.
  * The screensaver stops on keyboard or mouse events (key pressed, mouse movements or clicks), or by touching the screen on a tactile monitor, and the inactivity timer is restarted.
* The screensaver is disabled one minute before a scheduled recording starts. If the screensaver was active at that time, it stops, and the main Galicaster UI is displayed without any external interaction.

#### Loading and configuration:
In `conf.ini` (link to conf.ini), include the following sections with your values of choice:

```ini
[plugins]
screensaver = True

[screensaver]
inactivity = 60
```

`True`: *Enables plugin.*  
`False`: *Disables plugin.*  
`inactivity`: *Length of the inactivity period in seconds. Default value: 120 seconds.*


### No Audio Warning Dialog
This plugin triggers a pop-up dialog on the Recorder Area when the audio is muted, the microphone batteries are depleted or the audio is too low.

#### Behaviour:
###### The dialog shows up when:

* An audio recording device is muted.
* An audio recording device does not have enough power or battery charge.
* The audio input level is too low. The threshold is configurable and defaults to -80dB (see the configuration section for details).

###### The dialog hides when:

* The audio input level goes +5dB above the configured threshold.
* The "Close" button is clicked. It will stay closed until the audio level goes over the threshold and falls again.
* (Disabled by default) The "Keep Closed" button is clicked. The dialog will remain closed, regardless the audio level, until:
  * A new recording is started.
  * The current recording is stopped.
  * A new profile is loaded.
  * The current profile is reloaded.

#### Loading and configuration:
In `conf.ini` (link to conf.ini), include the following sections with your values of choice:

```ini
[plugins]
noaudiodialog = True

[audio]
min = -80
keepclosed = False
```

`True`: *Enables plugin*.  
`False`: *Disables plugin.*  
`min`: *A negative integer representing the 'silence' level in dB. Accepted values range between -100 and 0. Normal values are between -100 and -60. Defaults to -80.*

### Hide cursor and modify Ubuntu appearance
This plugin hides de Ubuntu Unity bar, removes the desktop workspaces and disables Ubuntu desktop lock. Also could hide the mouse cursor.

#### Loading
In `conf.ini` (link to conf.ini), include the following section with your value of choice:

```ini
[plugins]
appearance = False

[appearance]
hidecursor = False
```
`True`: *Enables plugin.*  
`False`: *Disables plugin.*  
`hidecursor`: *Enable or disable cursor*

### Check for a non-started scheduled recording
If the Galicaster unit is turned on after a scheduled recording should had been started, the recording will be lost. This pluging helps mitigating this problem by checking for a recording that should have already been started and starting it immediately for the remaining time. This plugin may also handle the merging of the resulting partial video and audio files generated

#### Behaviour
The plugin looks for recordings that should be currently running. If there is any, it is started immediately with its metadata - duration and start time - modified appropriately. The recovered recording will run for the remaining time only. An example:

* Recording scheduled from 10am to 12am.
* Computer started at 10:20.
* The recording will run from 10:20 to 12:00, resulting on a video 1 hour and 40 minutes long.

If merging is enabled the resulting partial audio and video files recorded will be concatenated into single continuous files and placed in the correct mediapackage with ammended metadata including recording duration. This merging can happen immediately or at nightly time.

#### Loading
In `conf.ini` (link to conf.ini), include the following code with your values of choice:

```ini
[plugins]
checkrepo = True

[checkrepo]
to_merge = False
delay_merge = False
```
`True`: *Enables plugin.*  
`False`: *Disables plugin.*  
`to_merge`: *Enables merging of the partial audio and video files generated from the restarted recordings.*  
`delay_merge`: *Enables delaying the merging behavior until the nightly timer in galicaster.*  

### Clean old recordings
This plugin deletes every recording older than a certain threshold. It is meant to keep enough free space on the hard drive, assuming the copies of the media in the recording units are not used as backup.

#### Loading and configuring
In `conf.ini` (link to conf.ini), include the following code with your values of choice:

```ini
[plugins]
cleanstale = True

[cleanstale]
maxarchivaldays = 30
checkoninit = False
```
`True`: *Enables plugin.*  
`False`: *Disables plugin.*  
`maxarchivaldays`: *An integer representing number of days the recording will be kept. Defaults to 30.*  
`checkoninit`: *Run the plugin when galicaster starts*

Note: This plugin will execute the process to delete on the hour configured as "nightly" in the section "heartbeat"

### Limit recording duration
This plugin is meant to stop manualkeyboard recordings missed by the lecturer.

#### Behaviour
All recordings stop when they reach the maximum duration configured.

#### Loading and configuring
In `conf.ini` (link to conf.ini), include the following code with your values of choice:

```ini
[plugins]
forcedurationrec = True

[forcedurationrec]
duration = 240
```
`True`: *Enables plugin.*  
`False`: *Disables plugin.*  
`duration`: *An integer representing the maximum duration allowed for a recording, in minutes. Defaults 240 minutes (4 hours).*


### REST interface (Experimental)
This plugin provides a simple REST web interface to retrieve information or control some actions on a running Galicaster instance.
This module requires the installation of the additional package `python-bottle`.

The available endpoints are:

* /state: Show several state values.

The REST server is listening in the port 8080 in all interfaces.
It can be accessed via localhost:8080 when the application is running.

```ini
[plugins]
rest = False

[rest]
port = 8080
```

`True`: *Enables plugin.*  
`False`: *Disables plugin.*


### Keyboard Shortcuts (Discontinued)
This plugin captures certain key combinations to trigger specific actions in Galicaster. The key combinations and their associated actions can be configured by the user. At the present time this plugin provides the possibility to exit typing "Ctrl + Shift + Q".

```ini
[plugins]
shortcuts = True
```
`True`: *Enables plugin.*  
`False`: *Disables plugin.*


### Setup the default values of any recording
#### Behaviour
This plugin defines the keys that will be pre-filled in the metadata when the "REC" button is pressed, these are:

* title: Sets up the default value for the recording title.
* presenter or creator: Sets up the default "Presenter" value.
* description: Sets up the default "Description" value.
* language: Sets up the default "Language" value.
* series, ispartof or isPartOf: Sets up the default "Series" id. The ID must exist, otherwise it will be ignored.

The following "placeholder" may be used in the previous values

* {user}: This string will be substituted by the current Unix login name. For instance: "presenter = {user}" will set up the default presenter value to the current user.

Moreover you can filtering series shown in the drop down list of the metadata editor. It accepts most of the filter values that Matterhorn endpoint accepts, namely: seriesId, seriesTitle, creator, contributor, publisher, rightsholder, createdfrom, createdto, language, license, subject, abstract, description.

According to the Matterhorn documentation, the date-like filters (createdfrom and createdto) must follow the format yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'. In addition to the previous filters, the 'default' keyword accepts a series ID that will appear in the series list, no matter what.

#### Loading
