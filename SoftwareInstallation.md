```
It is also necessary to install the following dependencies with pip:
```
pip install pyautogui
```


#### Source code
As an alternative, you can install Galicaster from the source code. Stable versions are available on the [Release Archive.](SoftwareInstallation/ReleaseArchive.md). Stable and development versions, as well as development information, are available in our [Git repository](http://github.com/teltek/Galicaster).

Installing a source code version requires installing its [dependencies](#dependencies) manually.
If a repository installation is also present, conf.ini and the profiles will be read from the folder /etc/galicaster. Otherwise, the ones in the installation folder will be used.

```
apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-dev gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-base-apps gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad-videoparsers gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad-faad gstreamer1.0-alsa gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio libgstreamer1.0-0 gir1.2-gstreamer-1.0 gir1.2-gtk-3.0 gir1.2-gst-plugins-base-1.0 python3-pycurl python3-bottle python3-icalendar python3-gi python3-dbus python3-simplejson python3-ldap python3-gst-1.0 python3-parse python3-pil onboard onboard-data libogg0 libvorbis0a libvorbisenc2 libsasl2-dev libldap2-dev libssl-dev python-is-python3 scrot python3-tk python3-dev

###### Adding a launcher
You can easilly add a launcher to a manual installation by creating a file at `/usr/local/bin/` containing the following command:
```bash
python3 <path>/run_galicaster.py
```
where `<path>` is the directory where you downloaded galicaster source code.

### Step 4: Install and configure drivers (Optional)
Depending on the hardware you have chosen to run Galicaster with, you may need to install and configure its drivers.

Check our [Compatible hardware](HardwareRecommendations/CompatibleHardware.md) and visit your device manufacturer's Driver & Info websites for information on how to install and configure the drivers.
